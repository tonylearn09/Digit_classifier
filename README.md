# Digit classifier 

In this project, I use C-svm and nu-svm in scikit-learn to classify the digits.
Besides, There are drawings for svms, and below are the symbols used in these figures:
> `+` signs indicates outliers 

> `.` indicates training examples 

> big `.` indicates support vectors.

For further explanation, check out our report.pdf.
